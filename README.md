# UnrealEngine4 Import for Unity
This package is intended to help migrate materials from Unreal Engine 4 to Unity. Not all UE4 nodes are currently supported but merge requests are welcome.

# Instructions
Documentation is currently light and is expected to be filled in as the project progresses. For now you can follow [this thread](https://forum.unity.com/threads/wip-tool-for-converting-ue4-materials-to-shadergraph.771854) on the Unity forums.

# Sample
There is a [sample project here](https://github.com/iainmckay/unity-unreal-converter-example) which you can download and use to convert materials.

# Dependencies
 - Unity 2020.1.0b14
 - ShaderGraph 8.x.x
